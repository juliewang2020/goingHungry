# goingHungry
Volhacks IV project


## Inspiration
Because of the rising cost of college, more and more students are facing food insecurity on campus as they have to decide between paying for tuition or food. We also joke a lot at our school that if you are smart, you could probably eat for free every day if you knew where to go.

## What it does
There are 2 main functions 1.) Provide an easier way for students to donate their dining dollars and dining swipes 2.) Provide a list of club events that will be serving food, and if that food is open to anyone, members first, members only, or will have leftovers.
